# Idea cork board

I approached the idea as a cork board with post its stickers on it, each new one will be placed on the right side of the last one added. Each idea has an edit and delete button, when a new idea added is placed at the end if there's no sorting type selected but on its right place when there is, when editing an idea it'll place it on the same position that it was before and then will sort all the ideas if a sorting type is selected. I created a few tests for IdeaBoard and IdeaCell. Eslint gives a few errors with the tests due to configuration but the rest is clean and styled. I added default properties to the components and accepted value types.

The app is created with create-react-app and has not been ejected. 

## Getting started
`yarn start` will run a development server on `http://localhost:3000`.  
`yarn test` will run the suite of tests created.
